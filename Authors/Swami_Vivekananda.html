              Swami Vivekananda was the chief disciple of Sri Ramakrishna
              Paramahansa. At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta. He was
              the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu
              philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought
              Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of
              the 19th century. Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in
              the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known
              for his inspiring speech beginning with "Sisters and Brothers of
              America". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of
              the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.

            <h2>Background & Childhood</h2>
            <p>
              Swami Vivekananda was born in Shimla Pally in Calcutta on 12
              January 1863. He was named Narendranath Datta. His father
              Vishwanath Datta was an attorney of Calcutta High Court. His
              mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi. Narendranath's thinking and
              personality were influenced by his parentsâ€”the father by his
              rational mind and the mother by her religious temperament. From
              his mother he learnt the power of self-control. Young Narendra was
              an expert in meditation and could enter the state of samadhi very
              easily. He saw a light while falling asleep. Once he had a vision
              of Buddha during his meditation. During his childhood, he had a
              great fascination for wandering ascetics and monks. He was also an
              expert in games and naughty things. Even in his young age he
              showed remarkable leadership qualities. His childhood friend was
              Kamal Reddy.
