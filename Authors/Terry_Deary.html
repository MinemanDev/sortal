                  Deary was born in Sunderland. His father Bill owned a butcher's shop in Hendon, a poverty stricken area of the city and his mother Freda 
                  was the manager of a clothing shop. Deary went to Monkwearmouth Grammar School and intensely disliked his school experience, particularly 
                  the style of teaching he received. He worked as a butcher's boy for much of his childhood, helping in the shop from the age of three. He 
                  joined the electricity board as a management trainee[5] when he was 18 and later the Theatre Powys drama company in 1972 and as an actor 
                  toured Welsh village halls bringing theatre to children. He qualified as a teacher at the Sunderland's College of Education and taught 
                  drama. He began writing in 1976, turning full-time in 1994, with the publication of the Horrible Histories series.

                <h2>Background & Childhood
                </h2>
                <p>The Horrible Histories series of books are popular among children for their interesting details, vast information and humorous pictures 
                    and among adults for getting children interested in history. Books in the series have been widely translated into other languages and 
                    imitated. A cartoon series has been made of the series of books and was shown on CiTV in 2002. The Horrible Histories live action comedy 
                    sketch show of the same name has been shown on CBBC since 2009. Deary himself has made irregular appearances on the show.
      
                </p>
                <p>Deary received an Honorary Doctorate of Education from the University of Sunderland in 2000. He supported AFC Sunderland[8][9].

                <p>
                      In 2011, he retired from writing children's books after 35 years. He lives in Burnhope, County Durham, England with his wife Jenny and their daughter Sara.
